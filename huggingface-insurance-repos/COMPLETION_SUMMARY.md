- Features: Multi-factor scoring, risk classification
- Tech: Gradio, Pandas, NumPy
- Status: ✅ DEPLOYED

**Repository 3: ifrs-claim-accrual-estimator**
- Purpose: IFRS 17 claim accrual estimation
- Features: Multiple estimation methods, confidence intervals
- Tech: Gradio, Pandas, NumPy
- Status: ✅ DEPLOYED

**Repository 4: doc-rag-compliance-assistant**

- Features: Semantic search, context-aware answers
- Tech: Gradio, Sentence Transformers, FAISS
- Status: ✅ DEPLOYED

**Repository 5: gcc-insurance-ai-hub**
- Purpose: Central navigation hub
- Features: Links to all tools, ecosystem overview
- Tech: Gradio
- Status: ✅ DEPLOYED (different org)

### What's Different from Plan

**Positive Surprises:**
1. All 4 main repositories already deployed (not just 1)
2. Hub deployed under gcc-insurance-intelligence-lab org
3. Additional spaces exist (policy-aware-claims, insurance-claims-decision-support)
4. Additional datasets exist (4 datasets total)
5. Model repository exists (claims-advisory-scoring-model)

**Discrepancies:**
1. Hub deployed under different organization than planned
2. Repo 1 has different app than built locally (data generator vs viewer)
3. More comprehensive ecosystem than originally scoped

### What This Means

**Good News:**
- Project is MORE complete than expected
- Ecosystem is larger and more comprehensive
- All core deliverables are live and accessible

**Action Items:**
- Verify all apps work correctly
- Understand the additional spaces/datasets
- Document the full ecosystem
- Test the hub navigation
