# Model Card: Automated Fraud Audit Log

## Model Details

### Description

Rule-based processing system for automated fraud audit log demonstration. This is not a machine learning model but a rule-based system for educational purposes.

- **Developed by:** GCC Insurance Intelligence Lab
- **Model Type:** Rule-based processing engine
- **Version:** 1.0
- **Framework:** Pure Python logic (no ML)
- **License:** MIT (Educational Use Only)

## Intended Use

### Primary Use Cases

✅ **Educational Training**: Training insurance professionals on automated fraud audit log concepts  
✅ **Logic Demonstration**: Demonstrating automated fraud audit log logic  
✅ **Workflow Prototyping**: Prototyping automated fraud audit log workflows  
✅ **Concept Validation**: Validating automated fraud audit log concepts  

### Out-of-Scope Use

❌ **Real Operations**: Not for actual insurance operations  
❌ **Production Decisions**: Not for production decisions  
❌ **Production Systems**: Not validated for live operations  

## Training Data

**N/A** - This is a rule-based system with no training data. The logic is defined by explicit rules, not learned from data.

### Synthetic Data Context

- 100% fabricated scenarios
- No real insurance data used
- Educational examples only
- No connection to actual operations

## Factors & Metrics

Rule-based system with configurable parameters for educational demonstration.

## Ethical Considerations

### Bias & Fairness

As a rule-based system, bias is limited to the rules defined. All logic is transparent and auditable.

### Mitigation Strategies

✅ **Transparency**: All logic is explicit and auditable  
✅ **Explainability**: Clear reasoning provided for all decisions  
✅ **Human Review**: Mandatory validation by professionals  
✅ **No Automation**: No automated decisions  

## Limitations

### Known Limitations

- Educational demonstration only
- No real-world validation
- Simplified model
- Not suitable for production use

### Technical Constraints

- Requires Python 3.9+
- Requires Gradio framework
- Local execution only

## Recommendations

### For Users

- Use only for educational purposes
- Always implement human review
- Do not use for production decisions
- Validate outputs with qualified professionals

### For Organizations

- Do not deploy for production use
- Implement appropriate governance
- Maintain professional oversight
- Document all decisions appropriately

## Governance

### Mandatory Requirements

- Human-in-the-loop for all decisions
- Clear disclaimers in all interfaces
- Synthetic data only
- Educational use only

### Compliance Notes

This system is designed for educational use only and must not be used for actual insurance operations.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture

Rule-based processing engine with Gradio interface.

### Compute Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Minimal memory requirements
- Local execution

### Dependencies

```
gradio==4.44.0
```

## Disclaimer

⚠️ **CRITICAL NOTICE**

Automated Fraud Audit Log demonstrates fictional insurance logic using synthetic data only. No outputs shall be used for actual insurance operations. All data and scenarios are fabricated for educational purposes.

**Human-in-the-loop is mandatory for all decisions.**

Organizations using this tool must:
- Comply with all applicable laws and regulations
- Implement appropriate governance and oversight
- Maintain professional standards
- Document all decisions with qualified professional approval
- Never rely on this system for actual insurance operations
